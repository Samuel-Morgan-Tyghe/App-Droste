## What I Learnt

To create this app i had to learn how classpaths work , at first i tried working with maven dewpendaciss
but i ran into issues of some of the libraries i needed weren't avalable , i learnt how to create them myself. but beofre executing i realised that it would be quicker to create a .jar with the libraries i would need in eclipse it would be export to .jar in inteliji it would be same but it's named artifact.
