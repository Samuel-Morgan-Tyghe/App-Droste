## What I Learnt

To create this app i had to learn how classpaths work , at first i tried working with maven dewpendaciss
but i ran into issues of some of the libraries i needed weren't avalable , i learnt how to create them myself. but beofre executing i realised that it would be quicker to create a .jar with the libraries i would need in eclipse it would be export to .jar in inteliji it would be same but it's named artifact and then import to dependancies. 

creating this app made me consider the user experience, from how to user interacts with the layout , how to avoid app crashes (try Catch)
